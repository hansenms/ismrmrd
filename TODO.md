To Do List for 2.x
==================

Questions
----------

* Should the stream number be and argument for append, since it is part of the header?
* Is it OK to remove measurement UID.
* Should the interface functions for times (time stamps and dwell times) include units (ns) to be explicit?
* Tests, should we test entity_type, storage_type, stream members? How?
* Should "contrast" be renames to "echo"? Should "echo" be added as an additional loop counter variable?
* Is the kspace_encode_step_0 handled correctly, or should it be kspace_encode_step_3 (we could add 4 too??)
* Should the complex data be stored as composite type or as basic real type.


Next steps
----------
* Change complex storage to compound type
* 

* Add Entity interface (serialization/deserialization).
* Add HDF5 code for images
* Add appendEntity and readEntity functions.
* Add classes for other entity types.
* Add HDF5 datatypes for all entity types.
* Add consistency checks for entity types and storage types and update tests accordingly.
